Hi!
My Easybank solution from Frontend Mentor

# Frontend Mentor - Easybank landing page

![Design preview for the Easybank landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Challenge is to build out this e-commerce homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard

**Built with**

- Mobile-first workflow
- HTML5 markup
- SASS/CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid/Flexbox
